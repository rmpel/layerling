## Who It Is For

You own a 3D printer. You want a part that fits something, not a career in CAD.

layerling works the way you already think: put a shape on the plate, drag it to size, turn a second shape into a hole, group the two, export, print. There is nothing to learn before you start and **nothing to sign up for** – open the page and build. Your designs stay in your own browser: no account, no cloud, nothing uploaded anywhere.

### Coming From Tinkercad?

You will recognise everything: the plate, the shapes, solids and holes, group and ungroup. Two things are waiting for you that you have been missing:

- **Chamfer and fillet.** Pick an edge and break it or round it – the one thing people ask for most once a printed part has to feel finished or slot into something. Applied edges stay reversible: take them off again whenever you like.
- **Real geometry underneath.** layerling keeps exact CAD shapes, not just a mesh, so a rounded edge stays a rounded edge – all the way into a STEP file for a full CAD program.

> **An AI can build along with you.** layerling ships an MCP server. An AI client such as Codex or Claude sees an open
> editor tab and works in it: add shapes, change measurements, group, cut, round edges, read the scene back, take pictures
> of the viewport. You describe the part, the AI builds it, you watch it happen and step in whenever you want. This runs
> locally, with nothing leaving the browser – see [layerling MCP Skill](#layerling-mcp-skill) for the setup.

## What It Does

### Building

- **A real build plate** – grid, snapping, handles for moving, resizing and rotating, and a panel with the exact numbers when you need them.
- **Type a position** – the Position card puts a body at exact X, Y and Z, and parts can be parked beside the plate, as in Tinkercad.
- **Snap to other shapes** – while moving, a shape locks its edges or centre onto the edges and centres of the shapes around it, with a guide line, so parts sit flush without typing numbers. Hold Alt to pause it.
- **Millimetres or inches** – with Imperial units every measure is shown in inches, as fractions like Tinkercad (1 5/8) or as decimals, the snap grid steps from 1/64 to 1 inch, and the plate's grid is drawn in inches.
- **Your printer's plate** – pick one of 190 common printers and the plate takes its size. Its name and build volume show in the corner of the workplane, and a warning appears when a body reaches past the edge.
- **Overhangs and filament** – "Show overhangs" hatches every face steeper than 45° (or your printer's own angle) that would need supports, and the export window shows volume, weight and metres of filament before you slice.
- **Shape library** – boxes, cylinders, spheres, cones, pyramids, wedges, text, roofs, half spheres, torus shapes, tubes, polygon prisms from three to twenty-four sides, coil springs and more.
- **Threads that fit** – threaded rods, screws with a socket, countersunk or hex head, hex nuts and tapped holes. M2 to M12, UNC/UNF from #4 to one inch and the Whitworth pipe threads G1/16 to G4 (ISO 228-1) are one pick away, or set your own diameter and pitch, left-hand as well; an inch or G size asks for threads per inch instead of millimetres. The ends take a chamfer, and a tapped hole is a cutter: drop it into a part, group, and the hole comes out threaded.
- **Solids and holes** – turn shapes into cutters and group them into the final geometry. Edit group (**E**) lays a group's parts loose to change them and rebuilds it with Done – also a group inside a group, as deep as the design goes.
- **Intersection** – keep only what two or more selected solids have in common, or where solids and holes overlap.

### Refining

- **Chamfer and fillet** – break or round any edge of a solid, and remove the treatment again later.
- **Hollowing** – turn a body into walls of one thickness, open at the top, the bottom, both or closed – for boxes, cups and cases.

### Files

- **Bring your own models** – import STL, OBJ, 3MF, STEP or SVG and build around it. A coloured OBJ – from layerling, or from Tinkercad as a ZIP with its `.mtl` – or a coloured 3MF, slicer projects included, comes in as one body per colour.
- **Export what your slicer wants** – STL, 3MF with names and colours, or OBJ with colours, for the selection or the whole scene (hidden parts stay out), plus STEP if the design should travel on into a full CAD program.
- **Projects as files** – save a whole project, history, sketches and groups included, as a `.lyl` file and carry on elsewhere. Older `.skf` files from earlier versions still open; saving then writes a `.lyl` beside them.
- **Bug report** – one link in the footer saves the design as a `.lyl` with the version, browser and last messages inside, ready to attach in the forum or on GitHub.
- **Designs you recognise** – everything lives in your own browser, each design with a thumbnail.

### Viewing

- **Perspective or straight-on** – switch between the normal view and a flat, orthographic one with the cube button beside the zoom controls, or by pressing **O**. Your viewing direction and framing are kept.
- **Turn the view at the cube** – dragging the view cube turns the view like the right mouse button, with one finger on a tablet; a click still jumps to that side.
- **Panels where you want them** – the object list, the settings, the section view, the tape measure and the tool panels for edges, hollowing and patterns move by their title bar and open there again; a double-click docks them.
- **Section view** – cut the view open along a plane across X, Y or Z to look at walls, cavities and parts that fit into each other, with a coarse and a fine slider. Only the view is cut: the design and every export stay whole. "Section as SVG" saves the cut itself at 1:1, for a laser or a template, and "Measure" reads wall thickness and gaps right on the cut, snapping square to the wall.
- **Workplane on any face** – press W and click a face to build on it; an eye hides the plane for a clear view while it keeps applying. An AI can set it on a face too.
- **On a tablet** – one finger works the design, exactly as the left mouse button does: tap to select, drag to move, drag on empty space for a selection box. **Two fingers belong to the view**: spread or pinch them to zoom, move them together to shift the workplane. Putting a second finger down takes back whatever the first one had started, so a pinch never nudges a part. Turning the view has no gesture of its own; the camera rail carries a switch for it, shown only on a touch screen, and while it is on, one finger orbits instead of selecting. Number fields hand you their whole value when you tap them, ready to be overwritten – a decimal keypad has no arrow keys to move the caret with.

- [Tinkercad Too Basic? Fusion 360 Too Much? Meet Layerling for 3D Printing](https://youtu.be/kzV7fQ3rXhw) – 3D Jesus | 3D Printing & Design (English). A first-time test of layerling without any manual.

## Getting Started

The shortest way is the hosted version. Nothing to install, nothing to sign up for – open it and build:

**https://layerling.com/**

The rest of this section is about running your own copy: on your computer, or on a machine in the workshop that everyone opens in their browser. Wherever the app is served from, the designs never leave the browser they were made in, and exports download straight to the person's own computer.

### Windows Quickstart

Never used a terminal before? On a Windows 11 (or current Windows 10) machine with nothing installed yet, open
**PowerShell** (search for it in the Start menu, no administrator rights needed) and paste this one line:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henmedia/layerling/main/scripts/windows-quickstart.ps1 | iex
```

It installs Git and Node.js if they are missing, downloads layerling into `%USERPROFILE%\layerling`, and opens it in
your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`. Leave the PowerShell window open while you use layerling; `Ctrl+C` in that
window stops it.

Run the very same line again whenever you want to **update** layerling – it notices the existing folder and pulls the
latest version instead of downloading it a second time. The script itself lives at
[`scripts/windows-quickstart.ps1`](scripts/windows-quickstart.ps1), so you can read exactly what it does before
running it, or download it and run it locally instead of piping it into PowerShell.

#### Opening It Again Later

The one-liner above also leaves a shortcut named **“Start layerling”** on your desktop. Double-click it whenever you
want to open layerling again – no PowerShell, no re-installing, no re-downloading, just the server starting and your
browser opening on its own. It also **updates layerling first** (when the folder has no changes of your own) and opens the
browser only once the server is really ready. Wanted layerling somewhere else, say on another drive? Run the script with
the folder you want:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henmedia/layerling/main/scripts/windows-quickstart.ps1))) -InstallPath "D:\3DPrinter\Layerling"
```

If your shortcut was made by an older version of the script, run the one-liner once more; it replaces the shortcut with the new one.

Prefer doing it by hand? Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\layerling
npm run dev
```

then open `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` yourself. `Ctrl+C` in that window stops it either way.

### Docker

To run layerling on a computer, NAS (Synology, Unraid, etc.) or home server without installing Node.js, use the included [`Dockerfile`](docker/Dockerfile) and [`compose.yml`](docker/compose.yml). The app listens on port **3000**.

1. **Install Docker.** On Windows or macOS, install and start [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). On Linux or a NAS you need Docker with Compose (`docker compose` or the standalone `docker-compose`).
2. **Get the files.** Either download the repository as a ZIP ([Code → Download ZIP](https://github.com/henmedia/layerling/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)) and extract it, or clone it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/henmedia/layerling.git
   cd layerling
   ```
3. **Start it.** In the project folder, open a terminal (e.g. PowerShell on Windows) and run:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up -d --build
   ```
   With the older standalone binary, write `docker-compose` instead of `docker compose`. Docker builds the image and runs the container in the background (`-d`); the first build takes about 2–3 minutes.
4. **Open it.** On the same computer at **`http://localhost:3000/`**, from other devices on your network at **`http://<YOUR-SERVER-IP>:3000/`**.

Everyday commands:

- **Stop:** `docker compose -f docker/compose.yml down`
- **Restart:** `docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up -d`
- **Update** (after pulling new code or extracting a new ZIP): `docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up -d --build`

The image runs `next start` in production mode, so the MCP bridge is not available there. To offer a shared project folder, bind a writable directory and set `LAYERLING_SHARED_PROJECTS_DIR` in `compose.yml` (see [Shared Designs on a Network](#shared-designs-on-a-network)).

### Shared Designs on a Network

If you run layerling with `npm run dev` or `npm run start` on a machine other people open in their browser, it can offer a
shared folder for `.lyl` designs. Point `LAYERLING_SHARED_PROJECTS_DIR` at a directory before starting:

```bash
LAYERLING_SHARED_PROJECTS_DIR=/srv/layerling-projects npm run start
```

The start page then shows a folder named **On the server** beside your browser designs. Open it and you are in that
folder: **New design** starts one right there, **New folder** makes a subfolder, and a trail under the heading says where
you are. A `..` tile leads back out. Designs move by dragging them onto a folder, onto that tile or onto a step of the
trail – or through **Move to …** in their menu. A design from your browser goes onto the server the same way: drag its
card onto the server folder.

The search box at the top searches the whole server folder, not just the one you are standing in. Every hit says
which folder holds it, and that folder is a button: one click and you are there, with the search cleared. Folders are
found by name too. While you are searching, the server tile on the start page says how many matches are waiting over
there.

**Duplicate** in a design's menu makes a copy of it. On the server the file itself is copied, next to the original and
under a free name, picture and all – nothing is repacked, so the copy carries exactly the geometry of the original. In
your browser the copy becomes a design of its own, with the same shapes, the same history and its own preview picture,
and it belongs to nobody on the server.

A design that lives on the server saves itself back there, five seconds after the last change and when you leave the
editor. Thumbnails land beside the files in `.thumbnails`. Designs that are only in your browser stay there, untouched.

Opening a design from the server gives you a private local working copy. Saving back checks the revision on the server
first; if someone else changed the file in the meantime, layerling refuses to overwrite it and asks you to reload or save
under a different name. This is shared file storage, not simultaneous editing.

#### Without Node: the `store` Folder

An installation served as a static export – plain files on a web server – cannot write anything by itself. For that case
`store.php` travels with the export. Create a folder named `store` next to `index.html` that the web server may write to,
and layerling offers the same shared storage as above, folders and all. Without the folder the feature stays invisible,
and the short guide in the editor explains how to switch it on. The web server needs PHP.

The folder has **no login**: whoever can reach the page can read, write and delete what is in it. On a home network or in
a workshop that is the point; on a publicly reachable site, protect it or leave it out.

One thing to remember when deploying: if you mirror the export with an option that removes anything extra – `rsync
--delete`, `robocopy /MIR`, WinSCP `-delete` – exclude `store` explicitly, or every update will wipe the projects.

### Desktop App

layerling also runs as a desktop app, for anyone who would rather have designs as files than in browser storage. It is
the same editor in a window of its own, with a File menu:

- **Designs are `.lyl` files** wherever you put them. *Save* (Cmd/Ctrl+S) writes the file, *Save As…* writes a new one,
  *Open…* and a double-click in the file manager open one. The start page lists what you opened recently.
- **Unsaved work is not lost.** Every change is kept as a draft until you save; quit or crash, and the design comes back
  as you left it, marked as having unsaved changes. *Revert to Saved* throws the draft away.
- **Nothing lives in browser storage.** Preferences are in `settings.json`, the list of designs in `documents.json`,
  drafts in `drafts/` – all in the app's data folder (`~/Library/Application Support/Layerling` on a Mac,
  `%APPDATA%\Layerling` on Windows, `~/.config/Layerling` on Linux).
- **The MCP bridge works** with the app as it does with `npm run dev`; the MCP server finds it on port 47615 by itself.

Build it for one target (Node.js as under [What You Need](#what-you-need)):

```bash
npm install
npm run desktop:build -- mac-arm64
```

Targets are `mac-arm64`, `mac-x64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `win-x64` and `win-arm64`; without one, the machine you
are on. The result lands in `dist-desktop/`. Add `--dir` for the unpacked app without an installer. So far only
`mac-arm64` has been built and tried; the Mac build is signed for the machine that built it, not notarized, and the app
does not update itself. `npm run desktop:dev` starts the app against the dev server, with hot reload.

To move designs over from the browser, save them there as `.lyl` (or use *Back up all*) and open them in the app.

## Working on layerling

Take this path if you want to change the code.

### What You Need

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm, included with Node.js

Check your versions with `node -v` and `npm -v`. If those commands do not work, install Node.js from the official
Node.js website and reopen your terminal.

### Install and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/henmedia/layerling.git
cd layerling
npm install
npm run dev
```

No Git? Press the green **Code** button on the GitHub page, choose **Download ZIP**, extract it, open a terminal in the
extracted folder and start with `npm install`.

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`. Leave the terminal open while you use the app; `Ctrl+C` stops the development server.

On Linux and macOS, `scripts/start-layerling.sh` does the daily start for you: it updates the checkout first (skipped if you changed files in it), starts the server, waits until it answers and then opens the browser. Run it from anywhere, for example `~/layerling/scripts/start-layerling.sh`. It needs Git and Node.js, as above. Port 3000 already taken? Start it with `PORT=3100 scripts/start-layerling.sh`. It has been tried on Debian Linux (without a desktop, so the browser step only prints the address) and in a Windows shell; macOS is untested – if it misbehaves on your system, please tell us in the discussions.

### Developing in a Container

Prefer not to install Node.js? Develop in a container instead. You need a container engine with Compose –
`docker compose` or `podman compose` (rootless Podman on SELinux works too; the `:z` flag in the compose file handles
the file labels):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yml up
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`. The first start installs dependencies; later starts go straight to the dev server with
hot reload. Stop it with `Ctrl+C`. If you update dependencies and something looks stale, delete `node_modules/` in the
project folder and start again.

Running the production container from `docker/compose.yml` at the same time? It uses port 3000 as well – change the
host-side port on one of them (e.g. `"3100:3000"`).

### Useful Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript checks |
| `npm run test` | Unit tests |
| `npm run test:e2e` | End-to-end tests |
| `npm run build` | Production build (`npm run start` serves it) |
| `npm run export` | Static export for plain web hosting |
| `npm run guide` | Build the user guide pages from `docs/guide` (the export and `npm run dev` do this too) |
| `npm run guide:images` | Retake the guide's pictures from the running program (needs `npm run dev -- -p 3010`; see `docs/guide/README.md`) |
| `npm run printers:update` | Refresh the printer presets from OrcaSlicer's profiles |
| `npm run mcp:layerling` | Start the MCP server for AI clients (see below) |

## layerling MCP Skill

layerling includes a local MCP server for AI clients that support MCP tools. It lets an agent inspect and control a live
editor tab: list open editors, read the scene, create, update and select objects, group, cut and separate parts, list CAD
edge ids, apply chamfer or fillet, hollow a body, inspect errors and capture viewport images.

It only works against a local development server: the MCP route is disabled in production builds and static hosting.

1. Start layerling from the project folder with `npm run dev` (see [Install and Run](#install-and-run)).
2. Open an editor tab, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:3000/?editor=1`.
3. Connect your AI client as described below. It starts the MCP server itself with
   `node scripts/layerling-mcp-server.mjs`.

The main tool names are `layerling_list_editors`, `layerling_read_scene`, `layerling_list_objects`,
`layerling_create_shape`, `layerling_update_object`, `layerling_list_edges`, `layerling_apply_edge_treatment`,
`layerling_hollow_object`, `layerling_array_objects`, `layerling_set_section_view` and `layerling_capture_image`.

### Claude Code

Nothing to install: the repo already ships `.mcp.json`, which registers the MCP server for this project, and a copy of the
skill at `.claude/skills/layerling-mcp-skill`, which is where Claude Code looks for one. Open the layerling folder in
Claude Code and ask:

```text
Use the layerling MCP tools to list my open layerling editors and inspect the current scene.
```

### Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop does not read a project's `.mcp.json` or skill files, but it can use the same MCP server through its own
config. Add the server there, using [`docs/mcp/claude-desktop-config.example.json`](docs/mcp/claude-desktop-config.example.json)
as the template and replacing the script path with the absolute path on your machine. After restarting Claude Desktop, ask:

```text
Use the layerling MCP tools to list open editors, inspect the scene, and modify the selected object.
```

### Codex

Copy the skill from `docs/skills/layerling-mcp-skill` into your Codex skills folder.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills" | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force "docs\skills\layerling-mcp-skill" "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\layerling-mcp-skill"
```

macOS or Linux:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R docs/skills/layerling-mcp-skill ~/.codex/skills/
```

Then add an MCP server entry to your Codex config, using [`docs/mcp/codex-config.example.toml`](docs/mcp/codex-config.example.toml)
as the template and replacing the script path with the absolute path on your machine. Restart Codex and ask:

```text
Use $layerling-mcp-skill to list my open layerling editors and inspect the current scene.
```

title: Measuring and notes
summary: Tape measure, ruler and framing square, distances to the origin, notes that stay attached to a part, and reference points that things snap to.
---

To build a part exactly, you need to measure. layerling has several tools for that. None of them ends up in an export. Wall thickness and gaps inside a part are best measured in the [section view](chapter:view-and-workplane) with {{ui:camera.sectionMeasure}}.

## The tape measure

The tape measure sits at the lower end of the camera bar on the left edge ({{ui:camera.tapeTools}}). It measures distances between corners, edges and faces. A click on it opens three buttons. If they cover what you want to measure, drag them by the grip on the left anywhere on the workplane; a double-click on the grip puts them back:

![The tape measure with its three buttons: add measurement, move measuring points, remove measurement.](shot:tape-menu)

1. **{{ui:camera.addMeasurement}}:** Click one point, drag to the next and click it. The distance is labelled.
2. **{{ui:camera.moveMeasurement}}:** Grab the points and move them, the number follows.
3. **{{ui:camera.deleteMeasurement}}:** Afterwards click a measurement to remove it.

[[Esc]] leaves measuring mode.

### Snapping to corners, edges and faces

While you add or move a point, the tape holds on to the body under the pointer and says what it found next to the pointer: {{ui:tape.snap.vertex}} for a corner, {{ui:tape.snap.midpoint}} for the middle of an edge, {{ui:tape.snap.centre}} for the centre of a round edge such as a hole or the rim of a cylinder, {{ui:tape.snap.note}} for a note or reference point, {{ui:tape.snap.edge}} when it lands on an edge, and {{ui:tape.snap.face}} when it lands on a surface, which is then lit up. On an edge or a face the point stays where you point; it is held exactly on that edge or in that face and moves in steps of the snap grid (bottom right): along an edge counted from its end, with the distance to the nearer end in the label, and on a flat face on the grid within that face. With the snap grid off it moves freely along the edge or face. Corners and edges at the back of a body are left out, so the point never jumps behind what you see. Hold [[Shift]] while clicking an edge to measure the whole edge at once. Hold [[Alt]] to place a point freely, without snapping. With bodies selected, the tape only snaps to those.

## The ruler

You fetch the {{ui:shape.ruler}} from the shape library. It is purely a measuring tool: it appears in no export and can neither be grouped nor cut. For every body that touches or overlaps the ruler, it shows the extent as a floating number right in the view. You can change that number right there, and the body follows. The floating plus symbol creates a copy of the measured shape.

## The framing square

Sometimes you measure better at a right angle. Click {{ui:camera.cornerRulerTool}} in the camera bar and then the workplane. A framing square with two arms at a right angle, with tick marks like a try square, is placed there. It has no body of its own either. Click close to the corner of a body, and its corner snaps exactly there.

The framing square lies on the workplane. If that sits on the side of a body, the square lies on that side too, see [View and workplane](chapter:view-and-workplane). That is how you dimension on a vertical wall: put the workplane on the wall, place the square at its top left corner and click the handle until the arms point right and down.

- **Dragging the handle** moves it.
- **A short click on the handle** turns it by 90°.
- **The ×** beside it removes it.
- **The small button left of the handle** switches what is measured from: the outside of a body (endpoint, an icon with lines) or its middle (midpoint, a crosshair).

If bodies stand at one of the arms, the framing square shows their dimensions automatically. That works on the base plate only, not on the side of a body.

When you select a body, the framing square shows in green how far it is from the corner, along both arms and in height. Click a green number to type a distance, and the body moves exactly there. With several bodies selected, they count as one: the ruler measures their shared outline, and a typed value moves them all together without changing their positions relative to each other.

With the midpoint, the green numbers count to the middle of the body, in height as well. That way you place a sphere with its centre exactly 15 mm from an edge, without subtracting the radius. On a wall you place a hole 40 mm from the left and 190 mm from the top like this: select the hole, switch to midpoint, type 40 and 190. The height there counts outward from the wall.

## Distances to the origin and while moving

In the settings under {{ui:workspace.appearance}} there are two switches for live dimensions:

- {{ui:workspace.showMoveDimensions}} shows by how much you move while dragging.
- {{ui:workspace.showOriginDimensions}} shows the distances of the selection to the origin of the plate, also with several selected bodies.

With {{ui:workspace.dimensionsAlwaysVisible}} the dimensions stay visible permanently.

## Notes

A note records what the geometry does not say: "This screw is 0.3 mm too tight", "print the lid yet", "dimension from Peter". Place one with {{ui:editor.tool.note}} or the [[N]] key.

- If you place the note **on a body**, it travels with it.
- If you place it **beside**, it stays on the workplane ({{ui:note.free}}).
- {{ui:note.detach}} releases an attached note from the body.
- Dragging moves the note, a click opens it for editing.

Notes are saved in the design, appear in no export and can be shown or hidden with {{ui:visibility.notes}}.

## Reference points

A reference point is a bare mark in space, like a pencil mark or a layout point in a workshop: it belongs to no body, is never printed, and other things snap to it. Right-click a body and choose {{ui:contextMenu.markCenter}}, {{ui:contextMenu.markCorners}} or {{ui:contextMenu.markMidpoints}}: the points appear on the top face of the body (of the whole selection, if you selected several).

- Drag a point to move it, or click it to see its coordinates and type new ones; they use the unit you set. The card can be dragged away by its title if it covers something, and a double-click on the title puts it back. {{ui:common.delete}} removes it.
- When you drag a shape, its edges and its centre snap to a point, like they snap to other shapes ({{ui:workspace.objectSnap}}). The framing square snaps to points too.
- Points are saved in the design, appear in no export, and are shown or hidden together with the notes by {{ui:visibility.notes}}.
- An AI can mark, list and remove them with `layerling_add_reference_points`, `layerling_list_reference_points` and `layerling_remove_reference_points`.
